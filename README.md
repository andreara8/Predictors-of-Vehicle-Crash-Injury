# Predictors-of-Vehicle-Crash-Injury
This is the fourth of a series of three projects completed for my Applied Econometrics course at UCLA's Master of Quantitative Economics. The objective is to be able to predict whether a vehicle crash will result in injury for any of the parties involved. To achieve this, we test various multinomial probit and logit models.
